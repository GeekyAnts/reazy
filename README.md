$ npm install -g reazy-cli
```

Generate the app
```sh
$ reazy init MyAwesomeApp [type]
```

**\[type\]:** mobile/web/plugin. Optional (You will be prompted later if you don't specify it here)

  - **mobile:** A simple React Native app with only the basic services.

  - **web:** A React project for web. Coming soon!

  - **plugin:** Scaffolding for a Reazy plugin.
